SELECT * FROM BUSINESS_BOOKS;

Row fetch times (rows in seconds):
    Without index: 2 in 0.007
    With index: 2 in 0.006
Analysis:
    There is a very small and unnoticeable performance increase. 
    It is probably due to the small amount of data we have, since avoiding searching all rows isn't that much beneficial with small amounts of data. 
    However, as we get to work with bigger tables, I would expect that difference to increase, since the database will know where to search the specified row.
